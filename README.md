```Learnings :-```



1. - [x] 
REQUEST METHOD:
- By making this application I got a clear understanding about the every essential Http requests like :

   - @Get
   - @Post
   - @Put
   - @Patch
   - @Delete



2. - [x] URL MANIPULATION : 

- And also learnt about how to describe the Http Requests by using annotations like :

   - @Path
   - @Body
   - @Query
   - @Query map

- And also learnt about @FormUrlEncoded and @Multipart but didn't find a way to implement these annotations in this application but will definitely going to use these in future as per the requirements.
